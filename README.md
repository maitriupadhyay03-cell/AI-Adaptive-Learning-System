# AI-Adaptive-Learning-System
# AI Adaptive Learning System

## Project Description
The AI Adaptive Learning System is a web-based platform designed to support students with disabilities by providing personalized learning experiences. The system uses Artificial Intelligence to analyze student learning behaviour and adapt learning materials according to individual needs.

The platform will allow students to access accessible learning resources while helping educators monitor progress and identify learning difficulties early.
This project is built using **Java (Maven-based build system)** and follows standard software engineering practices including modular design, testing, and CI/CD integration.

## Project Objectives
- Provide adaptive learning support for students with disabilities
- Improve accessibility to digital learning platforms
- Personalize learning content using Artificial Intelligence
- Enable educators to monitor student learning progress

## System Features (Planned)
- Student learning profiles
- AI-based learning recommendations
- Accessible learning materials
- Progress tracking dashboard
- Teacher feedback system

#### Custom Columns Added

To better reflect the development workflow, the following columns were added:

- **Testing**  
  Ensures all features are validated before completion.

- **Blocked**  
  Identifies tasks that are delayed due to dependencies or issues.

---

#### Labels Used

- `feature` – New functionality
- `bug` – Issues or defects
- `enhancement` – Improvements

---

#### Task Management

- User stories from Assignment 6 were converted into **GitHub Issues**
- Issues are linked directly to the Kanban board
- Tasks are assigned using **@mentions** myself (Rodrigue Ndzana)

---

#### Why These Customizations?

These changes improve:

- Workflow visibility  
- Quality assurance tracking  
- Issue identification  
- Team accountability  

This results in a more structured and efficient Agile process.

## From Class Diagrams to Code
with All Creational Patterns

### Creational Patterns Used

| Pattern | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| Simple Factory | Centralized content creation |
| Factory Method | Notification creation |
| Abstract Factory | Cross-platform UI |
| Builder | Complex content construction |
| Prototype | Efficient cloning |
| Singleton | Database connection |

### Design Decisions
- Builder used for flexible content creation
- Singleton ensures one DB connection
- Prototype reduces object creation cost

### CHANGELOG
- Implemented core classes (User, Student, Content)
- Added all creational patterns
- Added unit tests for all patterns
- Fixed Singleton thread safety
- Linked issues to commits

## Implementing a Persistence Repository Layer

### Repository Layer Design

The repository layer abstracts data storage using a generic interface:

- Repository<T, ID> provides CRUD operations
- InMemoryStudentRepository uses HashMap for fast testing
- RepositoryFactory enables switching between storage types
- Future database implementation is supported via stub classes

This design ensures:
- Separation of concerns
- Scalability
- Testability
 
## Service Layer and REST API Implementation
- Added UserService, ContentService, RecommendationService
- Implemented REST API endpoints
- Integrated Swagger documentation
- Added unit and integration tests
